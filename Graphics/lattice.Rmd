R graphics : Lattice
========================================================

Lattice is an r package based on the idea of displaying together multiple graphs depending on the same axis (like different sub-groups) while wasting as little space as possible. This graphics type is also called treillis graphics.

Lattice graphics have an internal representation. They are stored as an object, and drawn only when printed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("lattice")
```

See [ Lattice: Multivariate Data Visualization with R - Figures and Code](http://lmdvr.r-forge.r-project.org) for a comprehensive set of examples.
